# Employee-Details-Form
An employee form.
Created a form, collecting several data of an employee, after submitting, the submit button redirects to the listing page, which is in form of a table which is because it's using table as a theme. On the listing page there is a filter where user can filter the data by the email address. Then in the last column there's are action buttons - edit and delete, both the functions work by getting the row id.

Looks clean in Claro 10.0.0 (default theme, administration theme).
